# LizaAlert "Searcher Map"

[LizaAlert](https://lizaalert.org/) (aka LA) – is a non-profit volunteer

resque lost people across Russian Federation.

LizaAlert volunteers work hard on daily basis to **save lives** by arranging and
speeding up lost-people searches.

This repo covers open-sources front-end for interactive map of lost people.
Backend is supported by [LA Searcher Bot](https://t.me/LizaAlert_Searcher_Bot). The Map and Bot both are officially
not a part of LA central IT solutions, however it is developed from the scratch
& maintained by [one of LA Searchers](https://t.me/MikeMikeT).

Core audience of the Map and Bot – are LA Searches, that participate in
numerous "field" searches in urban / rural / natural environments.
